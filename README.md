This program will give you a solution to a given maze, it could be random generated or a one created by the user.

It will use the **backtracking method** with a stack, based on Position verifying if their possible paths were visited or not to solve it.
The program will draw the maze in a 640x480 window (could be changed) using __javax.swing__ library.

User can now create its own maze to be solved by the program.
Demonstrations with gifs below.

(Solved maze view it's now simpler, in order to see the path to final point)
