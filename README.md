# Maze-Solver-Backtracking

This program will give you a solution to a given maze, it could be random generated or a one created by the user.

It will use the **backtracking method**, based on Nodes verifying if their possible paths were visited or not to solve it.
The program will draw the maze in a 640x480 window (could be changed) using __javax.swing__ library.
