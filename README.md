# Maze-Solver-Backtracking

This program will give you a solution to a given maze, it could be random generated or a one created by the user.

It will use the **backtracking method** with a stack, based on Position verifying if their possible paths were visited or not to solve it.
The program will draw the maze in a 640x480 window (could be changed) using __javax.swing__ library.

User can now create its own maze to be solved by the program.
